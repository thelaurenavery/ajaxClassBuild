This is some plain text. We can parse this into our page using the responseText property. We can put anything we want here, and when we start looking at converting database queries into JSON documents the possibilities really are endless... change anything you want on the page. Give your user / client a CMS so that they can upload their own content, and then update a query so that they can get whatever content they need whenever they want it. All without a form or a page load. Pretty awesome.
